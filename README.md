# [Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/) Example

Just an example of how to deploy Plotly.js to chart data from a file. The motivation is to visualize data outside of ObservableHQ, which is not necessarily permitted in a work environment. This example shows how to marry the HTML scaffolding with a javascript file that does the actual work of manipulating and visualizing the code.
